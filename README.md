# Perseo Custom Search for WordPress

## Description

Perseo Custom Search is an open-source WordPress plugin that enhances search functionality on WordPress sites. It allows users to perform custom searches filtering by categories and keywords within sections identified by specific IDs. 
The plugin dynamically fetches and updates placeholders and categories via AJAX, providing a flexible and user-friendly search experience.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the zip file of the plugin from this GitHub repository.
2. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to 'Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin', and upload the zip file.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Use the shortcode `[perseo_custom_search]` in any post or page to display the custom search form.

### Customization

In the current release of Perseo Custom Search, categories filtered in the search form are set up through the plugin's backend code, and there isn't a feature available yet to configure them from the WordPress admin panel. 
Adjusting these settings requires modifications directly in the plugin's files.
If you need to customize categories or any other plugin settings and are not comfortable making these changes in the code, I am available to assist. 
Don't hesitate to reach out for support.

## Usage

After activation, simply insert the shortcode `[perseo_custom_search]` wherever you want the custom search form to appear on your site. The plugin handles the rest, from user input to displaying the search results.

## Development

This plugin is actively developed by Giovanni Manetti, with the source code available on GitHub. Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome.
